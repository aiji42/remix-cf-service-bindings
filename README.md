# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

You will be running two processes during development:

- The Miniflare server (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

Both are started with one command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!

## Deployment

Use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) to build and deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers. If you don't have it yet, follow [the installation guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) to get it setup. Be sure to [authenticate the CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication) as well.

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
